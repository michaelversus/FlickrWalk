# FlickrWalk

This is a demo app following the kommot challenge

I used the MVP architecture for the main app module and the Environment pattern as an easy way to handle Dependencies
For the challenge i am using region monitoring as i think it's the most appropriate for this use case (find more info inside LocationUtils README file)

I choose also to create 3 more modules as embeded frameworks for ease of use and seperate of concerns
Each module has unit tests and a README file.
